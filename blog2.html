            Organic farming is an eco-friendly approach to agriculture that
            avoids synthetic chemicals, promotes biodiversity, and enhances soil
            fertility. This method relies on natural fertilizers, composting,
            and biological pest control to maintain healthy crops while
            protecting the environment. By eliminating chemical pesticides and
            artificial fertilizers, organic farming prevents soil degradation
            and reduces water contamination. It also promotes healthier
            ecosystems by encouraging beneficial insects, birds, and
            microorganisms that contribute to natural pest control.

            Organic farming offers numerous benefits, primarily by prioritizing
            ecological balance and human health. It avoids synthetic pesticides,
            herbicides, and fertilizers, reducing chemical exposure for farmers
            and consumers. Organic practices enhance soil health through
            composting and crop rotation, leading to improved water retention
            and reduced erosion. This healthier soil also sequesters more
            carbon, mitigating climate change. While yields may sometimes be
            slightly lower, the nutritional value of organic produce can be
            higher. Furthermore, organic farming promotes biodiversity by
            creating habitats for beneficial insects and wildlife. It also
            supports local economies and offers a more sustainable approach to
            food production.
